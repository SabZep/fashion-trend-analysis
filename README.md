# Are cowboy boots making a comeback for the 2024 Fall season?

## Summary

**Background:**  What better time is there than autumn to romanticize the gloomy weather and find small things to enjoy? Latest reads for a rainy day inside, cozy wool trench coats and the infamous pumpkin spice lattes. The time for comforting seasonal treats indeed. Fashionwise, on the wild streets of Berlin, I have been observing more and more people wearing **cowboy boots**, tastefully styled with maxi dresses, midi skirts, wide leg jeans or denim shorts. 

This observation raises the question: are cowboy boots truly making a comeback this fall, or is this just a localized phenomenon, and an ordinary seasonal trend? By conducting a comprehensive analysis, I aim to understand the scope of this trend and provide insights for the fashion industry.

**Objectives:** Determine if cowboy boots are experiencing a significant increase in popularity during the 2024 fall season. Compare the current trend against historical seasonal data to assess its strength. Find out if there are specific geographic or demographic patterns. Evaluate if fashion retailers should adjust their inventory and marketing strategies in order to increase sales and meet a possible increase in demand.

**Methodology:** Gather data from Google Trends on search volume for cowboy boots and synonymous terms (e.g., 'Western boots,' 'country boots') over the past few years, with a particular focus on the fall period. Conduct exploratory data analysis with SQL queries and visualize the results using Tableau.

**Results:** 

**Business Recommendations:** Retailers should stock more cowboy boots to meet the anticipated increased demand. Targeted marketing on the website and newsletters, email campaigns and discounts for the 20-27 year old cohort in Berlin and Leipzig can be utilized to increase sales.
