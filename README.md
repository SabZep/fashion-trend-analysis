# Are cowboy boots making a comeback for the 2024 Fall season?

## Summary

**Background:**  What better time is there than Autumn to romanticize the gloomy weather and find small things to enjoy? Latest reads for a rainy day inside, cozy wool trench coats and the infamous pumpkin spice lattes. It is indeed the time for comforting seasonal treats. Fashionwise, on the wild streets of Berlin, I have been observing more and more people wearing **cowboy boots**, tastefully styled with maxi dresses, midi skirts, wide leg jeans or denim shorts. 

This observation raises the question: are cowboy boots truly making a comeback this fall, or is this just a localized phenomenon? By conducting a comprehensive analysis, I aim to understand the scope of this trend and provide insights for the fashion industry.

**Objectives:** Determine if cowboy boots are experiencing a significant resurgence in popularity during the 2024 fall season. Compare the current trend against historical seasonal data to assess its strength. Find out if there are specific geographic or demographic patterns. Evaluate if fashion retailers should adjust their inventory (e.g. offering more variety) and marketing strategies in order to increase sales.

**Unique Challenge:** (not sure about keeping this part but it could be something that justifies my specific analysis)

**Methodology:** Operationalize the search variable and make sure to cover all related terms such as Western boots, country boots etc. Gather data from (1) social media; pull data from Instagram, TikTok and Pinterest using hashtags and mentions, see if fashion shows and influencers are especially promoting this trend. (2) Use Google Trends for analyzing the search volume focusing on the past few years. (I am a little confused what analysis to add and test for significance here)
